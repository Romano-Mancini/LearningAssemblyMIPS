# Collatz Conjecture in MIPS Assembly

This repository contains a MIPS assembly program designed to compute the length of the Collatz sequence for a given starting number. The goal is to determine the number of elements in the sequence until it reaches 1.

## Overview

The program calculates the number of elements in the Collatz sequence starting from a given number n. According to the Collatz conjecture, this sequence eventually reaches the value 1, regardless of the starting number.
