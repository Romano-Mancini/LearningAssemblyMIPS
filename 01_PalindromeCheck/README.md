# Palindrome String Checker MIPS Assembly Program

This MIPS assembly program checks whether a string inputted by the user is a palindrome or not. Input is read character by character using system call 12 and ends when the user inputs '\n'. Since the number of characters inputted by the user is not known beforehand, the program utilizes the stack to store them instead of allocating a constant amount of memory.
