# Polynomial Evaluation in MIPS Assembly

This repository contains a MIPS assembly program designed to calculate the value of a third-degree polynomial using the method of finite differences. The program avoids the use of direct multiplication operations for polynomial evaluation.

## Overview

The program calculates the value of a polynomial p(x) of the form:
p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d
using finite differences. The goal is to calculate p(N).
