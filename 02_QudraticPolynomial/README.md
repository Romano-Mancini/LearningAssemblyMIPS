# MIPS Program for Determining if a Quadratic Equation has real solutions

This MIPS assembly program determines whether a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c has real solutions or not.
- The coefficients a, b, and c are signed integers inputted by the user.
- Conditional jumps in the program use only the instructions slt, beq, and bne.
- It is assumed that calculations do not result in overflow.
