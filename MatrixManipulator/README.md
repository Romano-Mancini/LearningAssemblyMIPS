# Matrix Symmetry and Diagonality Evaluator

This MIPS assembly program evaluates whether a given square matrix is symmetric or diagonal. It prints a value to the console indicating the matrix type:
- **2**: If the matrix is diagonal
- **1**: If the matrix is symmetric
- **0**: If the matrix is neither symmetric nor diagonal
